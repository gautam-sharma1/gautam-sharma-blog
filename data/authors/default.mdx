I am a software engineer. I got introduced to the world of software in my last year of undergrad and have been in love with it since then.

I learnt coding the hardway. I taught myself everything from scratch. I learned about memory layout, pointers, heap management, multithreading, web development, CI/CD, etc. I take pride in that.

I did my MS in Robotics and AI from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ.

Professionally, I work at MathWorks based in Boston, Massachusetts.
