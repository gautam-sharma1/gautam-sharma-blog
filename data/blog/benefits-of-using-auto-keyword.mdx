If you have written modern C++, I am 100% sure you might have come across the `auto` keyword. It gives an illusion of writing in a dynamically typed language which is a good thing
since C++ is notorious for scaring off beginners. I have been reading [Scott Meyers's](https://www.aristeia.com) Effective Modern C++, and I have to say I am learning so much from it. The following is my spin on benefits of using `auto` keyword.

## Prefer auto over std::function

Let's walk over a scenario in which you need to store a function pointer. The first thing that pops up in my mind is std::function. Here's how you do it

```cpp
void print_num(int i)
{
    std::cout << i << '\n';
}

// store a free function
std::function<void(int)> f_display = print_num;

```

It's looks great. Here's another way of doing it:

```cpp
auto f_display = print_num;
```

### Which one should you choose?

Both of these are correct and are valid C++ code. But, `std::function` is a [template](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/templates) initialization. So in simpler terms it will take up more memory. It might also allocate heap memory to store the closure. So in this case auto is the clear winner.

## Iterating over map in a for loop

Let's say you have the following `map` defined:

```cpp
std::unordered_map<std::string, int> my_map;
```

What do you think is the key type? If you think it's `std::string` you are wrong. It's `const std::string`. So imagine the following scenario - you want to iterate over the map in a for loop. So you write the following code:

```cpp
for(const std::pair<std::string, int> & keyValue: my_map){
    // do something
}
```

As I described, the key is `const std::string` but you, as a programmer get an illusion that it's `std::string`. With the above mentioned code, the compiler will make a `copy` of `my_map` in order to satisfy the constraints (`std::pair<std::string, int>`) you have put in the for loop. So now your `keyValue` will hold a reference to a `temporary` object that will be destroyed after the for loop. Seems scary isn't it.

Here's how you can avoid it:

```cpp
for(const auto & keyValue: my_map){
    // do something
}
```

`auto` will automatically derive the correct type of the `key`.

## Important caveat - `std::vector<bool>`

Although `auto` works out of the box for the most use cases, you really need to pay attention when using it with `std::vector<bool>`.
Let's assume you have the following data structure:

```cpp
std::vector<bool> cache_hit;
// Let's assume it gets initialized and contains valid entry
```

If you do something like:

```cpp
bool cache_status = cache_hit[0];
```

This will work fine. You will get the correct cache status. Now let's consider the case of using `auto`:

```cpp
auto cache_status = cache_hit[0];
```

This is <u className="dark:text-red-700">dangerous</u>. `auto` will try to get value by reference because of the [] operator and according to C++ standards, reference to bits is **forbidden**. So `std::vector<bool>` returns a proxy object that behaves as a reference. It returns `std::vector<bool>::reference`, not bool. Therefore, `cache_status` is a copy of this reference, not the actual boolean value. So when the `cache_status` gets initialized, the temp proxy object is <u className="dark:text-red-700">destroyed</u> from the stack and now `cache_status` contains a dangling reference.

By explicitly casting the result to bool, you ensure that `cache_status` contains the actual boolean value rather than a reference to it. This prevents unexpected behavior and ensures that your code behaves as expected.

```cpp

auto cache_status = static_cast<bool>(cache_hit[0]);
```

I hope this blog was helpful.
