## Overloading with Universal References

Imagine needing a function, `cache`, that can gracefully handle both lvalues and rvalues. You might initially implement it like this:

```cpp
std::set<std::string> _cache;

template<typename T>
void cache(T&& arg){
    _cache.emplace(std::forward<T>(arg));
}

std::string name = "Mary Jane";
cache(name); // Accepts lvalue
cache(std::string("Some Name")); // Accepts rvalue
cache("Another Name"); // Accepts string literal
```

### The Trap of Overloading

However, if you attempt to overload on universal references, you'll soon hit a snag. Consider this additional definition of `cache`:

```cpp
void cache(int idx);
```

Now, observe what happens with various calls:

```cpp
std::string name = "Mary Jane";
cache(name); // All good
cache(std::string("Some Name")); // Still fine
cache("Another Name"); // No problem

short idx  = 1;
cache(a); // Uh-oh, unexpected compile-time error
```

Even though the intention was clear, the overloaded universal reference version gets invoked due to C++ rules favoring the best match. Unfortunately, this results in adding a `short` to a set of strings, leading to a compilation error.

> Functions accepting universal references can be overly eager in grabbing arguments.

The situation becomes dire if you encounter constructors designed to accept universal references:

```cpp
class Widget{
  private:
       std::string uuid;
  public:
      template<typename T>
      Widget(T&& n):  uuid(std::forward<T>(n)){}
};

Widget w("1234");
auto cloneOfWidget(w); // Attempting to create a new widget fails to compile
```

The problem stems from the generated default copy and move constructors, which aren't what we expect. In reality, `Widget` looks more like this:

```cpp
class Widget{
  private:
       std::string uuid;
  public:
      template<typename T>
      Widget(T&& n):  uuid(std::forward<T>(n)){}
      Widget(const Widget&);
      Widget(Widget&&);
};
```

But when creating `cloneOfWidget`, it defaults to calling the universal reference constructor because it seems like a better match. This results in confusion and compilation errors.

To resolve this, adding a `const` qualifier to `w` helps guide the compiler:

```cpp
const Widget w("1234");
auto cloneOfWidget(w); // Now correctly invokes the copy constructor
```

Remember, in the realm of C++:

1. If both template and non-template instantiations are equally viable, the non-template function takes precedence.
