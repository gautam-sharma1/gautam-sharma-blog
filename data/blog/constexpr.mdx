title: Do you really know constexpr?
summary: constexpr is a keyword that was introduced in C++ 11 and revised in C++14. It is extremely versatile and it is a good practice to incorporate it in a lot of situations.

## Sneakiness of constexpr

I am assuming in your C++ journey, you might have come across constexpr for sure. While on the surface it looks like you are defining a `constant` expression, the questions is are you really doing that?

The answer is `yes` and `no`.

## Yes how?

If you are defining a variable as a constant, you are telling the compiler that the value of this variable is known at `compile time` (linking time to be accurate) and is `constant`:

```cpp
constexpr int a = 10; // Valid use
constexpr int b; // Will give a compiler error since value of b is unknown
```

In easy terms, every constexpr variable is const but not vice-versa.

## No how?

The real sneakiness of `constexpr` comes into play with functions. It is not `guaranteed` that a function defined as `constexpr` will indeed be evaluated at compile time. Here are two scenarios:

### All arguments of the function are available at compile time

The function will hence be computed at compile time. Example:

```cpp
constexpr int arg1 = 10;
constexpr int arg2 = 20;

constexpr int sum(int a, int b){
    return a + b;
}

sum(arg1,arg2); // Evaluated at compile time

int arr[sum(arg1,arg2)]; // Will compile fine
```

### One or more arguments of the function are not available at compile time

The function will be computed at runtime. Example:

```cpp
const int arg1;
constexpr int arg2 = 20;

constexpr int sum(int a, int b){
    return a + b;
}

sum(arg1,arg2); // Evaluated at run time

int arr[sum(arg1,arg2)]; // Will not compile
```

You can achieve two functionalities with this trick. You can make your function behave differently for different arguments.

## Wrapping up

`constexpr` functions only work with `literal types` as arguments and return types. Literal types include every built-in type except for `void`. It can also work with any user-defined types as well only if the user type has a constexpr constructors and member functions.

Example:

```cpp
class Database{
  std::string _fileName;
  public:
  constexpr Database(std::string fileName): _fileName(fileName){};
  constexpr std::string serialize(){
      // some logic here
  }
};

constexpr Database db("someFileName");
constexpr serializationResult = db.serialize();
```

### Note

Remember I said that `constexpr` functions do not work with `void`. Since C++14, `setters` are allowed to have a void return type as `constexpr` expressions.

Also, be very careful in defining any epxressions as `constexpr`. Once you do that, it's very difficult to revert back because your clients will suddenly start getting compile time errors.

Hope this helps.
