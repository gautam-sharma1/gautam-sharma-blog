## Knowing When to Use std::move and std::forward

Here's a simple rule:

> Use std::move when dealing with temporary values (rvalue references), and std::forward when handling universal references.

Check my earlier blog post for a detailed explanation of rvalue and universal references.

In short:

1. Rvalue references bind only to temporary values.
2. Universal references bind to both temporary and permanent values.

Let's dive into an example:

```cpp
class Database {
public:
    template <typename T>
    void setUUID(T&& uuidArg) {
        _uuid = std::move(uuidArg);
    }
    std::string _uuid;
};
```

If you recall from my previous blog, `T&&` in `setUUID` signifies a universal reference. Indeed it does. However, there's a subtle problem here. Let's consider how a client might use this function:

```cpp
Database db;
std::string uuid = "1234";
db.setUUID(uuid);
```

The client seems to be using `setUUID` correctly. But unfortunately, disaster strikes. `setUUID` **moves** the UUID, which is a permanent value (lvalue reference), into `_uuid`. This means the client's `uuid` now holds some garbage value. All because the current version of `setUUID` accepts universal references, allowing us to pass in a permanent value and then move it. This is very risky!

So now we understand why moving a permanent value is a bad idea. `std::move` should only be used for temporary values (rvalues). If our client called `setUUID` like this, there would be no issue:

```cpp
db.setUUID("1234"); // rvalue
```

But what's the fix?

You might suggest making `uuid` `const` and overloading the `setUUID` function:

```cpp
class Database {
public:
    void setUUID(const std::string& uuidArg) {
        _uuid = uuidArg; // set from permanent value
    }
    void setUUID(std::string&& uuidArg) {
        _uuid = std::move(uuidArg); // set from temporary value
    }
    std::string _uuid;
};
std::string uuid = "1234";
db.setUUID(uuid); // void setUUID(const T& uuidArg) will be called
```

But this is inefficient and requires more code. Plus, consider this:

```cpp
db.setUUID("1234");
```

It first creates a temporary string object, which then matches with the `void setUUID(std::string&& uuidArg)` function overload and gets moved.

> This overhead of creating a temporary object doesn't exist when using universal references as input.

So, what's the better solution?

### Universal References with std::forward

`std::forward` does a simple thing: it casts to a temporary value if the argument was initialized as one, otherwise it does nothing. For example:

```cpp
class Database {
public:
    template <typename T>
    void setUUID(T&& uuidArg) {
        _uuid = std::forward<T>(uuidArg);
    }
    std::string _uuid;
};

Database db;
std::string uuid = "1234";
db.setUUID(uuid); // std::forward keeps uuidArg unchanged since it was initialized as a permanent value;
db.setUUID("1234"); // std::forward casts uuidArg to a temporary value since it was initialized as one;
```

This is the correct approach.
