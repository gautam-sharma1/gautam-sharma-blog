**Grass is greener where you water it**

This is gonna be a short blog. I am just testing my custom blogging library that I just created. This blog is something to keep myself grounded and remind others of their individuality.&#x20;

Everyone is born <u>different</u>. In the middle of growing up, we all seem to lose our individuality. We all start being <u>envious</u> of other's success. We start comparing ourselves to others. That is the biggest disservice you can do to the creator.&#x20;

You were born to take a **_<u>unique path</u>_**. Be mindful of that. You were not created to compete with your fellows for a promotion. You were created to bring something unique to this world. I am not saying that you become an artist and leave the whole world behind. I am just saying that we all should feel happy and blissful everyday regardless if our day went well or not. The probability of being a human is extremely low so why waste it on things you can't control.

Be fearless and conquer the world.
