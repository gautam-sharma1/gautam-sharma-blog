## When to Return by Value from a Function?

If you've been following my previous blogs, you might be eager to use `std::move`. At some point, you might consider using it to return a value from a function. This blog will discuss whether that's a good idea or not.

### Proper Use Case for Returning by Move

Imagine you have a function that receives an r-value reference and performs some operation on it, then wants to return it. In this scenario, using `std::move` could be advantageous.

```cpp
Tensor operator+(Tensor&& lhs, const Tensor& rhs){
    lhs += rhs;
    return std::move(lhs);
}
```

Since `lhs` is an l-value (because it's a parameter) bound to an r-value reference, using `std::move` is beneficial. If `Tensor` doesn't support move construction, that's fine too because in that case, the copy constructor will be called.

### Proper Use Case for Returning by Forward

Let's adjust our previous example to work with universal references.

```cpp
template <typename T>
Tensor sum(T&& tensor){
    tensor.sum();
    return std::forward<T>(tensor); // moves r-value; copies l-value
}
```

In this function, the return statement acts as `std::move` for r-values and a no-op for l-values. This means the move constructor will be called for r-values and the copy constructor for l-values.

### When Not to Use Move and Forward

In the C++ standard, there are two rules stating that compilers may elide the copying or moving of objects that are returned by value if:

1. The type of the local object is the same as that returned by the function.
2. The local object is what's being returned.

Let's look at an example:

```cpp
Tensor makeTensor(){
    Tensor t;
    return t;
}
```

This copies `t` to the returned `Tensor`, but in reality, the compiler will perform return value optimization (RVO) and elide the copy because the first two conditions were met. However, if you use `std::move` in the return, you will hurt performance because now there won't be any RVO since `std::move` produces an r-value reference and doesn't satisfy the conditions mentioned before. So it will force the compiler to not perform RVO and perform a move or copy.

Let's say you are insistent on using `std::move` because you don't trust the compiler. For you, there is another rule: 3. If compilers choose not to perform copy elision, the object being returned _must_ be treated as an r-value.

So, for our `makeTensor` function, if the compiler chooses not to perform RVO, it has to cast the return value to an r-value. In that case, `makeTensor` will look like this:

```cpp
Tensor makeTensor(){
    Tensor t;
    return std::move(t);
}
```

All that to say:

> Do not over-optimize your code. The compiler is mostly one step ahead.
