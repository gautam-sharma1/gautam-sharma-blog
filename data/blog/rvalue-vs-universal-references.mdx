## Universal References vs Rvalue References

Let's clear up the confusion between `T&&` in C++. It's not just about rvalue references; there's another concept called universal references.

### What's an Rvalue Reference?

Simply put, an rvalue reference is a reference that can bind to a temporary value. For example:

```cpp
MyClass&& a = MyClass(); // Here, 'a' is an rvalue reference
```

### What's a Universal Reference?

A universal reference is a type of reference that can bind to both lvalues and rvalues. Check this out:

```cpp
auto&& a = MyClass(); // Here, 'a' is a universal reference
auto&& b = a; // 'b' also becomes a universal reference
```

### How Do They Differ?

At first glance, they might seem similar, but there's a subtle difference.

Universal references typically appear in template functions like this:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void foo(T&& args)
{
    // Do something
}
```

In this case, `args` is a universal reference.

On the other hand, if we have something like this:

```cpp
template<class T>
class MyClass {
    void foo(T&& args)
    {
        // Do something
    }
};
```

Here, `args` is an rvalue reference.

How can you tell them apart?

It's simple. For something to be a universal reference, two conditions must be met:

1. The parameter must be in the form `T&&`. It can also be like `Args&& ...`.
2. The type of the argument must be deduced when the function is called.

For example:
In `MyClass::foo()`, the type `T` isn't deduced when calling the function. It's deduced when initializing `MyClass`. So, `args` here is an rvalue reference.

But in `foo()`, the type needs to be deduced, making it a universal reference.

Another example:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void f(const T&& param); // 'param' is an rvalue reference
```

Since `auto` also leads to type deduction, this:

```cpp
auto&& x = MyClass();
```

Makes `x` a universal reference.
